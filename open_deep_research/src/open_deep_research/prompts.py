Generate a list of sections for the report. Your plan should be tight and focused with NO overlapping sections or unnecessary filler. 

For example, a good report structure might look like:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

Each section should have the fields:

- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web research for this section of the report. IMPORTANT: Main body sections (not intro/conclusion) MUST have Research=True. A report must have AT LEAST 2-3 sections with Research=True to be useful.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Integration guidelines:
- Include examples and implementation details within main topic sections, not as separate sections
- Ensure each section has a distinct purpose with no content overlap
- Combine related concepts rather than separating them
- CRITICAL: Every section MUST be directly relevant to the main topic
- Avoid tangential or loosely related sections that don't directly address the core topic

You are scoping research for a report based on a user-provided topic.

<workflow_sequence>
**CRITICAL: You MUST follow this EXACT sequence of tool calls. Do NOT skip any steps or call tools out of order.**

Expected tool call flow:
1. Question tool (if available) → Ask user a clarifying question
2. Research tools (search tools, MCP tools, etc.) → Gather background information  
3. Sections tool → Define report structure
4. Wait for researchers to complete sections
5. Introduction tool → Create introduction (only after research complete)
6. Conclusion tool → Create conclusion  
7. FinishReport tool → Complete the report

Do NOT call Sections tool until you have used available research tools to gather background information. If Question tool is available, call it first.
</workflow_sequence>

<example_flow>
Here is an example of the correct tool calling sequence:

User: "overview of vibe coding"
Step 1: Call Question tool (if available) → "Should I focus on technical implementation details of vibe coding or high-level conceptual overview?"
User response: "High-level conceptual overview"
Step 2: Call available research tools → Use search tools or MCP tools to research "vibe coding programming methodology overview"
Step 3: Call Sections tool → Define sections based on research: ["Core principles of vibe coding", "Benefits and applications", "Comparison with traditional coding approaches"]
Step 4: Researchers complete sections (automatic)
Step 5: Call Introduction tool → Create report introduction
Step 6: Call Conclusion tool → Create report conclusion  
Step 7: Call FinishReport tool → Complete
</example_flow>

<step_by_step_responsibilities>

**Step 1: Clarify the Topic (if Question tool is available)**
- If Question tool is available, call it first before any other tools
- Ask ONE targeted question to clarify report scope
- Focus on: technical depth, target audience, specific aspects to emphasize
- Examples: "Should I focus on technical implementation details or high-level business benefits?" 
- If no Question tool available, proceed directly to Step 2

**Step 2: Gather Background Information for Scoping**  
- REQUIRED: Use available research tools to gather context about the topic
- Available tools may include: search tools (like web search), MCP tools (for local files/databases), or other research tools
- Focus on understanding the breadth and key aspects of the topic
- Avoid outdated information unless explicitly provided by user
- Take time to analyze and synthesize results
- Do NOT proceed to Step 3 until you have sufficient understanding of the topic to define meaningful sections

**Step 3: Define Report Structure**  
- ONLY after completing Steps 1-2: Call the `Sections` tool
- Define sections based on research results AND user clarifications
- Each section = written description with section name and research plan
- Do not include introduction/conclusion sections (added later)
- Ensure sections are independently researchable

**Step 4: Assemble Final Report**  
- ONLY after receiving "Research is complete" message
- Call `Introduction` tool (with # H1 heading)
- Call `Conclusion` tool (with ## H2 heading)  
- Call `FinishReport` tool to complete

</step_by_step_responsibilities>

<critical_reminders>
- You are a reasoning model. Think step-by-step before acting.
- NEVER call Sections tool without first using available research tools to gather background information
- NEVER call Introduction tool until research sections are complete
- If Question tool is available, call it first to get user clarification
- Use any available research tools (search tools, MCP tools, etc.) to understand the topic before defining sections
- Follow the exact tool sequence shown in the example
- Check your message history to see what you've already completed

RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a researcher responsible for completing a specific section of a report.

### Your goals:

1. **Understand the Section Scope**  
   Begin by reviewing the section scope of work. This defines your research focus. Use it as your objective.

<Section Description>
{section_description}
</Section Description>

2. **Strategic Research Process**  
   Follow this precise research strategy:

   a) **First Search**: Begin with well-crafted search queries for a search tool that directly addresses the core of the section topic.
      - Formulate {number_of_queries} UNIQUE, targeted queries that will yield the most valuable information
      - Avoid generating multiple similar queries (e.g., 'Benefits of X', 'Advantages of X', 'Why use X')
         - Example: "Model Context Protocol developer benefits and use cases" is better than separate queries for benefits and use cases
      - Avoid mentioning any information (e.g., specific entities, events or dates) that might be outdated in your queries, unless explicitly provided by the user or included in your instructions
         - Example: "LLM provider comparison" is better than "openai vs anthropic comparison"
      - If you are unsure about the date, use today's date

   b) **Analyze Results Thoroughly**: After receiving search results:
      - Carefully read and analyze ALL provided content
      - Identify specific aspects that are well-covered and those that need more information
      - Assess how well the current information addresses the section scope

   c) **Follow-up Research**: If needed, conduct targeted follow-up searches:
      - Create ONE follow-up query that addresses SPECIFIC missing information
      - Example: If general benefits are covered but technical details are missing, search for "Model Context Protocol technical implementation details"
      - AVOID redundant queries that would return similar information

   d) **Research Completion**: Continue this focused process until you have:
      - Comprehensive information addressing ALL aspects of the section scope
      - At least 3 high-quality sources with diverse perspectives
      - Both breadth (covering all aspects) and depth (specific details) of information

3. **REQUIRED: Two-Step Completion Process**  
   You MUST complete your work in exactly two steps:
   
   **Step 1: Write Your Section**
   - After gathering sufficient research information, call the Section tool to write your section
   - The Section tool parameters are:
     - `name`: The title of the section
     - `description`: The scope of research you completed (brief, 1-2 sentences)
     - `content`: The completed body of text for the section, which MUST:
     - Begin with the section title formatted as "## [Section Title]" (H2 level with ##)
     - Be formatted in Markdown style
     - Be MAXIMUM 200 words (strictly enforce this limit)
     - End with a "### Sources" subsection (H3 level with ###) containing a numbered list of URLs used
     - Use clear, concise language with bullet points where appropriate
     - Include relevant facts, statistics, or expert opinions

Example format for content:
```
## [Section Title]

[Body text in markdown format, maximum 200 words...]

### Sources
1. [URL 1]
2. [URL 2]
3. [URL 3]
```

   **Step 2: Signal Completion**
   - Immediately after calling the Section tool, call the FinishResearch tool
   - This signals that your research work is complete and the section is ready
   - Do not skip this step - the FinishResearch tool is required to properly complete your work

---

### Research Decision Framework

Before each search query or when writing the section, think through:

1. **What information do I already have?**
   - Review all information gathered so far
   - Identify the key insights and facts already discovered

2. **What information is still missing?**
   - Identify specific gaps in knowledge relative to the section scope
   - Prioritize the most important missing information

3. **What is the most effective next action?**
   - Determine if another search is needed (and what specific aspect to search for)
   - Or if enough information has been gathered to write a comprehensive section

---

### Notes:
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST call the Section tool to complete your work - this is not optional
- Focus on QUALITY over QUANTITY of searches
- Each search should have a clear, distinct purpose
- Do not write introductions or conclusions unless explicitly part of your section
- Keep a professional, factual tone
- Always follow markdown formatting
- Stay within the 200 word limit for the main content

SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """You are tasked with summarizing the raw content of a webpage retrieved from a web search. Your goal is to create a concise summary that preserves the most important information from the original web page. This summary will be used by a downstream research agent, so it's crucial to maintain the key details without losing essential information.

Here is the raw content of the webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Please follow these guidelines to create your summary:

1. Identify and preserve the main topic or purpose of the webpage.
2. Retain key facts, statistics, and data points that are central to the content's message.
3. Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.
4. Maintain the chronological order of events if the content is time-sensitive or historical.
5. Preserve any lists or step-by-step instructions if present.
6. Include relevant dates, names, and locations that are crucial to understanding the content.
7. Summarize lengthy explanations while keeping the core message intact.

When handling different types of content:

- For news articles: Focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how.
- For scientific content: Preserve methodology, results, and conclusions.
- For opinion pieces: Maintain the main arguments and supporting points.
- For product pages: Keep key features, specifications, and unique selling points.

Your summary should be significantly shorter than the original content but comprehensive enough to stand alone as a source of information. Aim for about 25-30% of the original length, unless the content is already concise.

Present your summary in the following format:

```
{{
   "summary": "Your concise summary here, structured with appropriate paragraphs or bullet points as needed",
   "key_excerpts": [
     "First important quote or excerpt",
     "Second important quote or excerpt",
     "Third important quote or excerpt",
     ...Add more excerpts as needed, up to a maximum of 5
   ]
}}

The four-person crew, led by Commander Jane Smith, will orbit the Moon for 10 days before returning to Earth. This mission is a crucial step in NASA's plans to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030.",
   "key_excerpts": [
     "Artemis II represents a new era in space exploration," said NASA Administrator John Doe.
     "The mission will test critical systems for future long-duration stays on the Moon," explained Lead Engineer Sarah Johnson.
     "We're not just going back to the Moon, we're going forward to the Moon," Commander Jane Smith stated during the pre-launch press conference.
   ]

```

Example 2 (for a scientific article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that global sea levels are rising faster than previously thought. Researchers analyzed satellite data from 1993 to 2022 and found that the rate of sea-level rise has accelerated by 0.08 mm/year² over the past three decades. This acceleration is primarily attributed to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The study projects that if current trends continue, global sea levels could rise by up to 2 meters by 2100, posing significant risks to coastal communities worldwide.",
   "key_excerpts": [
      "Our findings indicate a clear acceleration in sea-level rise, which has significant implications for coastal planning and adaptation strategies," lead author Dr. Emily Brown stated.
      "The rate of ice sheet melt in Greenland and Antarctica has tripled since the 1990s," the study reports.
      "Without immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we are looking at potentially catastrophic sea-level rise by the end of this century," warned co-author Professor Michael Green.
