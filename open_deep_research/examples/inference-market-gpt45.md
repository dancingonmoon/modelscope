## Deep Dive: Fireworks AI

**Fireworks AI provides a flexible inference platform optimized for deploying and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), emphasizing ease of use, scalability, and performance customization.**

The platform supports two primary deployment modes: serverless inference and dedicated deployments. Serverless inference allows quick experimentation with popular pre-deployed models like Llama 3.1 405B, billed per token without guaranteed SLAs. Dedicated deployments offer private, GPU-based infrastructure with performance guarantees, supporting both base models and efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addons.

Fireworks AI's Document Inlining feature notably extends text-based models into multimodal capabilities, enabling visual reasoning tasks by seamlessly integrating image and PDF content. Performance optimization techniques include quantization, batching, and caching, tailored to specific use cases such as chatbots and coding assistants requiring low latency.

Competitively, Fireworks AI positions itself against providers like OpenAI and Cohere, with a recent Series B funding round of $52M, total funding of $77M, and estimated annual recurring revenue (ARR) around $6M.
