# Open Deep Research

Open Deep Research is an experimental, fully open-source research assistant that automates deep research and produces comprehensive reports on any topic. It features two implementations - a [workflow](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/) and a multi-agent architecture - each with distinct advantages. You can customize the entire research and writing process with specific models, prompts, report structure, and search tools.

### ðŸš€ Quickstart

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research.git
cd open_deep_research
```

Then edit the `.env` file to customize the environment variables (for model selection, search tools, and other configuration settings):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Launch the assistant with the LangGraph server locally, which will open in your browser:

#### Mac

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies and start the LangGraph server
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.11 langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

#### Windows / Linux

```powershell
# Install dependencies 
pip install -e .
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]" 

# Start the LangGraph server
langgraph dev
```

(2) The report is produced as markdown.

#### Workflow

(1) Provide a `Topic`:

<img width="1326" alt="input" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de264b1b-8ea5-4090-8e72-e1ef1230262f" />

(2) This will generate a report plan and present it to the user for review.

(3) We can pass a string (`"..."`) with feedback to regenerate the plan based on the feedback.

### Using the package

```bash
pip install open-deep-research
```

See [src/open_deep_research/graph.ipynb](src/open_deep_research/graph.ipynb) and [src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.ipynb](src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.ipynb) for example usage in a Jupyter notebook:

## Open Deep Research Implementations

Open Deep Research features two distinct implementation approaches, each with its own strengths:

## 1. Graph-based Workflow Implementation (`src/open_deep_research/graph.py`)

The graph-based implementation follows a structured plan-and-execute workflow:

- **Planning Phase**: Uses a planner model to analyze the topic and generate a structured report plan
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Allows for human feedback and approval of the report plan before proceeding
- **Sequential Research Process**: Creates sections one by one with reflection between search iterations
- **Section-Specific Research**: Each section has dedicated search queries and content retrieval
- **Supports Multiple Search Tools**: Works with all search providers (Tavily, Perplexity, Exa, ArXiv, PubMed, Linkup, etc.)

This implementation provides a more interactive experience with greater control over the report structure, making it ideal for situations where report quality and accuracy are critical.

You can customize the research assistant workflow through several parameters:

- `report_structure`: Define a custom structure for your report (defaults to a standard research report format)
- `number_of_queries`: Number of search queries to generate per section (default: 2)
- `max_search_depth`: Maximum number of reflection and search iterations (default: 2)
- `planner_provider`: Model provider for planning phase (default: "anthropic", but can be any provider from supported integrations with `init_chat_model` as listed [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html))
- `planner_model`: Specific model for planning (default: "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest")
- `planner_model_kwargs`: Additional parameter for planner_model
- `writer_provider`: Model provider for writing phase (default: "anthropic", but can be any provider from supported integrations with `init_chat_model` as listed [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html))
- `writer_model`: Model for writing the report (default: "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
- `writer_model_kwargs`: Additional parameter for writer_model
- `search_api`: API to use for web searches (default: "tavily", options include "perplexity", "exa", "arxiv", "pubmed", "linkup")

## 2. Multi-Agent Implementation (`src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.py`)

The multi-agent implementation uses a supervisor-researcher architecture:

- **Supervisor Agent**: Manages the overall research process, plans sections, and assembles the final report
- **Researcher Agents**: Multiple independent agents work in parallel, each responsible for researching and writing a specific section
- **Parallel Processing**: All sections are researched simultaneously, significantly reducing report generation time
- **Specialized Tool Design**: Each agent has access to specific tools for its role (search for researchers, section planning for supervisors)
- **Search and MCP Support**: Works with Tavily/DuckDuckGo for web search, MCP servers for local/external data access, or can operate without search tools using only MCP tools

This implementation focuses on efficiency and parallelization, making it ideal for faster report generation with less direct user involvement.

You can customize the multi-agent implementation through several parameters:

- `supervisor_model`: Model for the supervisor agent (default: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
- `researcher_model`: Model for researcher agents (default: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest") 
- `number_of_queries`: Number of search queries to generate per section (default: 2)
- `search_api`: API to use for web searches (default: "tavily", options include "duckduckgo", "none")
- `ask_for_clarification`: Whether the supervisor should ask clarifying questions before research (default: false) - **Important**: Set to `true` to enable the Question tool for the supervisor agent
- `mcp_server_config`: Configuration for MCP servers (optional)
- `mcp_prompt`: Additional instructions for using MCP tools (optional)
- `mcp_tools_to_include`: Specific MCP tools to include (optional)

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

The multi-agent implementation (`src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.py`) supports MCP servers to extend research capabilities beyond web search. MCP tools are available to research agents alongside or instead of traditional search tools, enabling access to local files, databases, APIs, and other data sources.

**Note**: MCP support is currently only available in the multi-agent (`src/open_deep_research/multi_agent.py`) implementation, not in the workflow-based workflow implementation (`src/open_deep_research/graph.py`).

### Key Features

- **Tool Integration**: MCP tools are seamlessly integrated with existing search and section-writing tools
- **Research Agent Access**: Only research agents (not supervisors) have access to MCP tools
- **Flexible Configuration**: Use MCP tools alone or combined with web search
- **Disable Default Search**: Set `search_api: "none"` to disable web search tools entirely
- **Custom Prompts**: Add specific instructions for using MCP tools

### Filesystem Server Example

#### SKK

```python
config = {
    "configurable": {
        "search_api": "none",  # Use "tavily" or "duckduckgo" to combine with web search
        "mcp_server_config": {
            "filesystem": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": [
                    "-y",
                    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                    "/path/to/your/files"
                ],
                "transport": "stdio"
            }
        },
        "mcp_prompt": "Step 1: Use the `list_allowed_directories` tool to get the list of allowed directories. Step 2: Use the `read_file` tool to read files in the allowed directory.",
        "mcp_tools_to_include": ["list_allowed_directories", "list_directory", "read_file"]  # Optional: specify which tools to include
    }
}
```

#### Studio

MCP server config: 
```
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
      "/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/open_deep_research/src/open_deep_research/files"
    ],
    "transport": "stdio"
  }
}
```

MCP prompt: 
```
CRITICAL: You MUST follow this EXACT sequence when using filesystem tools:

1. FIRST: Call `list_allowed_directories` tool to discover allowed directories
2. SECOND: Call `list_directory` tool on a specific directory from step 1 to see available files  
3. THIRD: Call `read_file` tool to read specific files found in step 2

DO NOT call `list_directory` or `read_file` until you have first called `list_allowed_directories`. You must discover the allowed directories before attempting to browse or read files.
```

MCP tools: 
```
list_allowed_directories
list_directory 
read_file
```

Example test topic and follow-up feedback that you can provide that will reference the included file: 

Topic:
```
I want an overview of vibe coding
```

Follow-up to the question asked by the research agent: 

```
I just want a single section report on vibe coding that highlights an interesting / fun example
```

### Configuration Options

- **`mcp_server_config`**: Dictionary defining MCP server configurations (see [langchain-mcp-adapters examples](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters#client-1))
- **`mcp_prompt`**: Optional instructions added to research agent prompts for using MCP tools
- **`mcp_tools_to_include`**: Optional list of specific MCP tool names to include (if not set, all tools from all servers are included)
- **`search_api`**: Set to `"none"` to use only MCP tools, or keep existing search APIs to combine both

### Common Use Cases

- **Local Documentation**: Access project documentation, code files, or knowledge bases
- **Database Queries**: Connect to databases for specific data retrieval
- **API Integration**: Access external APIs and services
- **File Analysis**: Read and analyze local files during research

The MCP integration allows research agents to incorporate local knowledge and external data sources into their research process, creating more comprehensive and context-aware reports.

## Search API Configuration

Not all search APIs support additional configuration parameters. Here are the ones that do:

- **Exa**: `max_characters`, `num_results`, `include_domains`, `exclude_domains`, `subpages`
  - Note: `include_domains` and `exclude_domains` cannot be used together
  - Particularly useful when you need to narrow your research to specific trusted sources, ensure information accuracy, or when your research requires using specified domains (e.g., academic journals, government sites)
  - Provides AI-generated summaries tailored to your specific query, making it easier to extract relevant information from search results
- **ArXiv**: `load_max_docs`, `get_full_documents`, `load_all_available_meta`
- **PubMed**: `top_k_results`, `email`, `api_key`, `doc_content_chars_max`
- **Linkup**: `depth`

Example with Exa configuration:
```python
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
                           "search_api": "exa",
                           "search_api_config": {
                               "num_results": 5,
                               "include_domains": ["nature.com", "sciencedirect.com"]
                           },
                           # Other configuration...
                           }}
```

## Model Considerations

(1) You can use models supported with [the `init_chat_model()` API](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chat_models_universal_init/). See full list of supported integrations [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html).

(2) ***The workflow planner and writer models need to support structured outputs***: Check whether structured outputs are supported by the model you are using [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/).

(3) ***The agent models need to support tool calling:*** Ensure tool calling is well supoorted; tests have been done with Claude 3.7, o3, o3-mini, and gpt4.1. See [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/adc5d60c-97ee-4aa0-8b2c-c776fb0d7bd6/d).

(4) With Groq, there are token per minute (TPM) limits if you are on the `on_demand` service tier:
- The `on_demand` service tier has a limit of `6000 TPM`
- You will want a [paid plan](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/47#issuecomment-2640992272) for section writing with Groq models

(5) `deepseek-R1` [is not strong at function calling](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/reasoning_model), which the assistant uses to generate structured outputs for report sections and report section grading. See example traces [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/07d53997-4a6d-4ea8-9a1f-064a85cd6072/r).  
- Consider providers that are strong at function calling such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and certain OSS models like Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- If you see the following error, it is likely due to the model not being able to produce structured outputs (see [trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/8a6da065-3b8b-4a92-8df7-5468da336cbe/r)):
```
groq.APIError: Failed to call a function. Please adjust your prompt. See 'failed_generation' for more details.
```

(6) Follow [here[(https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research/issues/75#issuecomment-2811472408) to use with OpenRouter.

(7) For working with local models via Ollama, see [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research/issues/65#issuecomment-2743586318).
